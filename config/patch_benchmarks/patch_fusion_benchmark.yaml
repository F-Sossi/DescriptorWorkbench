# HPatches Patch Fusion Benchmark Configuration
#
# This configuration evaluates descriptor fusion strategies on pre-extracted
# HPatches patches, isolating the fusion effect from keypoint location quality.
#
# Run: ./patch_benchmark ../config/patch_benchmarks/patch_fusion_benchmark.yaml
# Or:  ./patch_benchmark --patches ../hpatches-release --descriptor hardnet

  name: "patch_fusion_benchmark"
