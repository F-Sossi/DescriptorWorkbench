# Descriptor Performance Analysis Notebooks

This directory contains comprehensive Jupyter notebooks for analyzing descriptor comparison experiment results directly from the SQLite database.

## üéØ Analysis Objectives

**Systematic analysis of descriptor modifications to quantify the individual and combined effects of:**
- **Pooling strategies** (None vs Domain-Size Pooling vs Stacking)
- **Color usage** (Grayscale SIFT vs Color RGBSIFT)
- **Normalization strategies** (L1 vs L2)
- **Interaction effects** between modifications

## üìä Notebook Overview

### 1. `01_descriptor_performance_overview.ipynb`
**Comprehensive performance dashboard and baseline establishment**

- **Performance metrics**: MAP, P@1, P@5, processing times
- **Comparative analysis** across descriptor families
- **Dataset breakdown** by scene type (illumination vs viewpoint changes)
- **Interactive visualizations** with Plotly
- **Statistical summaries** and exportable results

**Key Outputs:**
- Performance comparison dashboard
- Statistical summaries by descriptor type
- Processing time vs accuracy trade-offs
- Exportable CSV data for further analysis

### 2. `02_pooling_stacking_effects.ipynb`
**Focused analysis of pooling strategy impacts**

- **Pooling strategy comparison**: None vs DSP vs Stacking
- **Statistical significance testing** (ANOVA, pairwise t-tests)
- **Effect size analysis** (Cohen's d)
- **Interaction effects** with color usage
- **Computational trade-off analysis**

**Key Outputs:**
- Pooling performance heatmaps
- Statistical significance tests
- Best performing descriptor+pooling combinations
- Performance improvement quantification

### 3. `03_systematic_modification_analysis.ipynb`
**Individual and combined modification effects**

- **Baseline establishment**: Pure SIFT performance
- **Individual modification impact**: Color, pooling, normalization
- **Combination effects**: How modifications interact
- **Performance attribution**: Waterfall analysis
- **Synergistic effects**: Non-additive performance gains

**Key Outputs:**
- Individual modification impact quantification
- Performance attribution waterfall charts
- Synergy effect analysis
- Best configuration identification

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install analysis dependencies
pip install -r ../requirements.txt

# Or using conda
conda env create -f ../environment.yml
conda activate descriptor-compare
```

### Running the Analysis
1. **Ensure experiments have been run** and database is populated:
   ```bash
   cd ../../build
   ./keypoint_manager list-scenes  # Verify keypoints exist
   ./experiment_runner ../config/experiments/sift_systematic_analysis.yaml
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Lab**:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

3. **Run notebooks in order**:
   - Start with `01_descriptor_performance_overview.ipynb` for baseline analysis
   - Proceed to `02_pooling_stacking_effects.ipynb` for pooling-specific insights
   - Finish with `03_systematic_modification_analysis.ipynb` for comprehensive attribution

## üìà Expected Results

Based on initial experiments, you should see results similar to:

### Performance Hierarchy:
1. **SIFT + DSP**: ~37.0% MAP (+2.6% improvement)
2. **SIFT Baseline**: ~36.1% MAP (baseline)
3. **SIFT + Stacking**: ~36.1% MAP (minimal change)

### Key Insights:
- **DSP pooling** provides consistent ~2-3% MAP improvement
- **Color information** (RGBSIFT) effects vary by scene type
- **L1 vs L2 normalization** shows minimal impact
- **Combination effects** may show synergistic benefits

## üìÅ Output Structure

Results are automatically exported to `../outputs/`:
```
outputs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ descriptor_performance_analysis.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pooling_effects_analysis.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ systematic_modification_analysis.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ performance_summary.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pooling_strategy_summary.csv
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ individual_modification_effects.csv
```

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Analysis
To analyze additional descriptor types or modifications:

1. **Update experiment configs** in `../../config/experiments/`
2. **Run new experiments** with `experiment_runner`
3. **Modify notebook queries** to include new descriptor types
4. **Update parsing functions** in notebooks for new naming conventions

### Database Schema
The notebooks expect this database structure:
```sql
experiments: id, descriptor_type, pooling_strategy, ...
results: experiment_id, mean_average_precision, precision_at_1, ...
```

## üé® Visualization Features

- **Interactive Plotly dashboards** for exploration
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn plots** for publication-ready figures
- **Performance heatmaps** for easy comparison
- **Waterfall charts** for attribution analysis
- **Statistical plots** with confidence intervals

## üìä Research Applications

These notebooks support research questions such as:
- Which pooling strategy is most effective for your descriptor?
- How much does color information contribute to performance?
- Are there synergistic effects when combining modifications?
- What is the computational cost vs accuracy trade-off?
- Which modifications provide the best ROI for your use case?

## üîÑ Integration with Pipeline

The analysis system integrates seamlessly with the experiment pipeline:
1. **Design experiments** using YAML configs
2. **Run experiments** with database tracking
3. **Analyze results** with these notebooks
4. **Export findings** for publication or further analysis
